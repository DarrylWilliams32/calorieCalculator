# Calorie Calculator (HTML, CSS, JS)
This project is a build that was part of the curriculum of Freecodecamp. It's a project that I'll be building upon and making more functional for myself or others to use. 

## Future Updates
* Integrate an API to import common food items
* Add the ability to create your own recipes
* Provide functionality to calculate individual calories based on BMR (basal metabolic rate)
* Add mobile site / app
